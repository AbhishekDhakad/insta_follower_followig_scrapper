# insta_follower_followig_scrapper
This is a python code to get instagram followers or following in text file. I used selenium for automation.
you need to download chrome webdriver of same version as of your chrome browser. After download, put webdriver.exe file in the same directory where you save your python code.
After that you also have to install selenium module by giving command "pip install selenium".
